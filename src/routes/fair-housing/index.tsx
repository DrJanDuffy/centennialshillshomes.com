              Centennial Hills Real Estate | Homes by Dr. Jan Duffy is committed to providing equal 
              professional service to all persons, regardless of race, color, religion, sex, handicap,

              We believe that everyone deserves equal access to housing opportunities and fair treatment in 
              real estate transactions.

              individuals from discrimination in all aspects of the housing process.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing based on:

              identity, or source of income. We comply with all applicable fair housing laws, including federal, 
              state, and local laws.

            <h2>Reporting Discrimination</h2>
            <p>
              If you believe you have been discriminated against in housing, you have the right to file a 
              complaint with the appropriate authorities. Housing discrimination is illegal, and there are 
              resources available to help you report and address discrimination.
            </p>
            <p>
              You may file a complaint with:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD):</strong> 
              HUD is the federal agency responsible for enforcing the Fair Housing Act. You can file a complaint 
              with HUD by phone at 1-800-669-9777, online at www.hud.gov/fairhousing, or by mail. HUD will 
              investigate your complaint and take appropriate action if discrimination is found.</li>
              <li><strong>Nevada Equal Rights Commission:</strong> 
              The Nevada Equal Rights Commission enforces state fair housing laws. You can file a complaint by 
              phone at (702) 486-7161 or through their website. The commission investigates complaints and can 
              take enforcement action.</li>
              <li><strong>Local Fair Housing Organizations:</strong> 
              Local fair housing organizations may also be able to assist you with filing complaints and 
              provide resources and support.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Complaints must typically be filed within one year of the alleged discrimination. It is important 
              to file complaints promptly to preserve your rights and ensure that discrimination can be 
              addressed effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you believe you have experienced discrimination, we encourage you to report it. Discrimination 
              is illegal and should not be tolerated. Reporting discrimination helps protect your rights and 
              prevents future discrimination against others.
            </p>

              We are committed to addressing any fair housing concerns promptly and appropriately. If you have
